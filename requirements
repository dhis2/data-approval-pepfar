Approval process 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
First the implementing partners approve the data on country level.
Second the funding agency approve the data on country level.
Third the country teams approve the data on country level.
Fourth the HC approves data on global level.


Functionality questions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Approval will be multiple data sets at the same time. ?
How is this tree connected?

Allow dataApprovals api to accept requests for multiple datasets
??Think about dataset groups.

To display the datasets we can use the already available services?
http://localhost:8080/dhis/api/dataApprovals?ds=Zqg76KonUx1&pe=2014&ou=ybg3MO3hcf4
http://localhost:8080/dhis/dhis-web-reporting/generateDataSetReport.action?ds=Zqg76KonUx1&pe=2014&ou=ybg3MO3hcf4


Use cases/stories
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The data sets will be "Grouped" by a system variable list. (System setting json structure)
    - This list is based on the access that the user has to the individual data sets
    - The app should check which datasets are available and only show these
    - If there is just one option this one should be preselected
    - If there is more than one data set group choice, they should be displayed in alphabetical order.

The user selects a variable from the list.
    - The datasets that are in that list will be shown on the screen
        - The data sets are shown in alphabetical order by data set name.
        - It only shows the data sets that contain some data for the current selection
        - Datasets that don't have data show "No data for this selection."
            - Note: This can still be approved

    - At the top of the page, show the names of the data sets on the page, 
      a shortcut links within the page down to each section showing the data set.
    - The user can approve/accept/unapprove/unaccept the data by "groups"
        - When approving a "group" all the datasets in this group will be approved
    
Terminology
    - Dhis approve === PEPFAR submit

Tree Levels:
    Global: http://localhost:8080/dhis/api/organisationUnits.json?filter=level:eq:2&fields=id,name,level,parent[id,name]&filter=parent.id:eq:ybg3MO3hcf4
    Funding Agency: http://localhost:8080/dhis/api/categoryOptionGroupSets/bw8KHXzxd9i.json <!!!!!! Differnce between items and categoryOptionGroups
    Implementing partner: http://localhost:8080/dhis/api/categoryOptionGroupSets/BOyWrF33hiR.json <!!!!!! Differnce between items and categoryOptionGroups
        - The second level is filtered like this: only those partners are shown where there is a category option belonging to that partner that also belongs to the agency.
    ????? >>The third level is the category option combination (only those combinations where one of the options belongs to both the partner immediately above and to the agency two levels above.) Again, for PEPFAR, the category option combinations all contain only one category option: "Funding Mechanism".

    Funding mechanism is a category not a category option?

    Third level is basically the level for which options the implementing partner gets money from the funding agency

    If implementing partner ATB gets money from DOD for program B and gets money from USAID for program B and C the tree would be

    Global
        Kenya
            DOD
                ATB
                    program B
            USAID
                ATB
                    program B
                    program C



================================================================================
================================================================================

No "attribute category combination"??

For approval levels that have a category option group set, approval will 
be by attribute category combination, instead of by category option group.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Set Section? -- What is this?

Data set

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. I will add a system setting that PEPFAR will use to require acceptance at one approval level before the data can be approved(submitted) up to the next level. This might not affect your code in any way, but just so you're aware.

Why? Should this not be displayed somewhere?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The approval report allows the user to select an organisation unit.

5. (the big one) The approval report allows the user to select an organisation unit. If (a) the data set contains an attribute category combination, and (b) the level of the selected organisation unit is contained in one or more approval levels (see Settings -> Approval), and (c) if those approval levels contain a category option group set, then the approval report displays a dropdown menu called "Approval entity" below the organisation unit selection box. This dropdown contains the category option groups that belong to the category option group set(s) specified in the approval level(s) matching the selected org unit level.

5. The tree structure? Is also based on this kind of? 
When 

a) Still confused what this is?

b) http://localhost:8080/dhis/api/organisationUnits.json?filter=level:eq:2&fields=id,name,level
    in
   http://localhost:8080/dhis/api/dataApprovalLevels.json

c) if categoryOptionGroupSet in http://localhost:8080/dhis/api/dataApprovalLevels.json
    then
    categoryOptionGroups for that categoryOptionGroupsSet for that level
