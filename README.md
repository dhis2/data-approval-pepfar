# PEPFAR Approvals DHIS2 App
**Repo Owner:** Ben Guaraldi [@benguaraldi](https://github.com/benguaraldi)

To set up:
1. Run `yarn add gulp`
2. Run `bower install`
3. Run `gulp build-prod`
4. Copy `approvals.zip` to a DATIM server
5. Voil√†!

(I did use `deploy true` as well as downloading [d2js](https://github.com/Markionium/d2-legacy) and adding it to `src/vendor/d2js`, in case the five steps above are not sufficient.)
